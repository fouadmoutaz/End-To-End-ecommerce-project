# Data Engineering for E-commerce: An End-to-End Project

## Project Description

Welcome to our comprehensive end-to-end data engineering project tailored for e-commerce. In this project, We have meticulously crafted a streamlined data pipeline to handle diverse datasets from various sources. The journey involves extracting data from CSV files, utilizing Alteryx for minimal transformations, transferring it to SQL Server for staging, and further refining it with Power Query transformations. Finally, we delve into SQL Server for data modeling and leverage Power BI for insightful analysis.

### Key Components:

#### ETL Workflow with Alteryx:
Explore the Alteryx workflow that efficiently extracts data from CSV files and loads it into SQL Server with minimal transformations, ensuring a smooth transition from source to the staging area.

#### Power Query Transformations:
Witness the power of Power Query as it refines and transforms data within the SQL Server staging area, ensuring data quality and integrity before proceeding to the modeling phase.

#### Data Modeling in SQL Server:
Delve into the intricacies of data modeling, where the structure of the data warehouse, including dimension and fact tables, is meticulously crafted for analytical purposes.

#### SQL Analysis for Strategic Insights:
Experience the synergy of SQL Server and Power BI as We leverage queries to uncover valuable insights, enabling informed decision-making in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.

### Project Highlights:
